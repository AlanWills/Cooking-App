  steps:
  - title: Prepare Pastry
    description: Remove your pastry from the fridge.

  - title: Prepare Filling
    description: 'If using sausage meat, put it into a medium bowl and massage with
      your handes so it''s no longer a block.


      If using sausages, open the
      pack(s) and ensure you have a sharp knife to hand.'

  - title: Prepare Filling
    description: 'Skip this step if using sausage meat.


      Using the sharp knife,
      cut about halfway into the sausage along its full length.  <b>Gently</b> peel
      the casing off the sausage, starting at the cut.'
    tip: It can help to slightly pull the sausage apart along the cut to find a hold
      on the casing.
    warning: 
    recommendation: Being gentle whilst peeling the casing off means it's more likely
      to all come off in one go.

  - title: Prepare for Rolling Pastry
    description: 'Lightly dust a large area of work surface with flour, making sure
      sure you have some more flour nearby in case.


      If using pastry that
      needs rolling, dust the rolling pin with flour too.'
    tip: If you don't have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle instead.
    warning: 
    recommendation: Pour a small pile of flour on the work surface before rolling. 
      When you need more flour, it is easier to take from there than a bag or a jar,
      especially if you have dirty hands.

  - title: Rolling Pastry
    description: 'If using pre-rolled pastry, slowly roll it out onto the floured
      surface.  Dust the top side with flour, then flip it and make sure that side
      is dusted too (some flour should already be on there).


      If using pastry
      that needs rolling, begin gently rolling the pastry block into a rectangle
      about twice as long as it is wide.  Stop when it is about 5mm thick.


'
    tip: Occasionally flip the pastry to its other side so that it rolls out evenly.
    warning: Take your time and focus on rolling out any large clumps of pastry,
      especially at the edges.
    recommendation: It's better for the pastry to be too thick than too thin, so
      if you're not sure be cautious.  The more you do this, the better you will
      be at understanding how thick the pastry should be.

  - title: Arrange Filling
    description: 'Cut the pastry along its length so that it is divided into two
      long strips.  Split the filling into two roughly equal parts and arrange in
      a long and thin cylinder on the pastry.


      Finally, add chutney or a viscous
      sauce along the whole length of the filling.'
    tip: It can be useful to put the filling slightly over to one side, so that you
      have more pastry on the other side to fold over.
    warning: It's better to have the chutney on the side of the filling that will
      be folded over.  The other side will be used to close the pastry and it could
      get messy.
    recommendation: Don't worry if the filling is not perfectly distributed.  As
      long as it forms a rough cylinder along the whole length of the pastry, things
      will be fine!

  - title: Fold Pastry
    description: Fold the pastry over the meat and use a fork to press the two edges
      of the pastry together.
    tip: 
    warning: If the filling is in the wrong position, you may not have enough pastry
      to fold over.  If this is the case, you will need to move the filling slightly.

  - title: Prepare for Cooking
    description: Add baking paper to a baking tray.  Cut the pastry along its length
      using a sharp knife and arrange on the baking tray.
    tip: Leave a bit of space between the rolls as they can expand when cooked.
    warning: When cutting, do not press down as the filling can come out of the pastry. 
      Instead, let the sharp knife do the work and just gently cut back and forth.
    recommendation: You can cut these as big or as small as you like, although it's
      best not to make them thin.

  - title: Add Eggwash
    description: Crack the egg into a small bowl, whisk it with a fork and apply
      it to each portion using a pastry brush.
    tip: If you don't have a pastry brush, you can use a fork to add the egg to the
      pastry and your fingers to brush it around.
    warning: 
    recommendation: If you don't have a pastry brush, get one, they're incredibly
      useful.

  - title: Bake!
    description: 'Add the tray to the oven and bake for 30 minutes.  If the pastry
      has puffed and browned, remove and arrange on a cooling rack.


      If you
      think they need a little longer, put them back in the oven for 5 minutes.'
    tip: Timings will vary from oven to oven, how many sausage rolls you've made
      and their size - that's OK, just change the recipe for next time!
